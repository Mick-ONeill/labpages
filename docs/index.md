# Welcome to the Home Loab Guide
This is a wee guide to show how you can setup a functioning home lab environment using Proxmox, whatever AMD64 system you might have laying around, and some minimal viable knowledge.

The main reason for me to put this together was to show case that you can easily put an environment together, host a small Kubernetes cluster, and learn a whole heap along the way while breaking things of no consequence. Hopefully it helps you avoid rebuilding everything 50 times like I did because I really have no idea wtf I'm doing. 

This isn't intended as step by step guide on anything in particular, but more to share the resources I used, the gotchas you might encounter, and share any wisdom gained. 

On the topic of sagely wisdom, for the love all the gods, RTFM.
